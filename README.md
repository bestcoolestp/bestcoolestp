## 🧠 DevOps Philosophy

I focus on:

- reproducibility over manual steps  
- automation over heroics  
- reliability over novelty  
- documentation that enables handoff  

I treat infrastructure as a system that must be **operated**, not just built.

## 🧪 Previous Software Engineering Work (Archive)

I previously built a wide range of applications across:

- JavaScript / Angular
- C# / ASP.NET / .NET Core / Blazor
- Node.js / MongoDB / SQL
- REST APIs, real-time apps, data visualization

These projects demonstrate **strong engineering fundamentals** that now support my DevOps/SRE transition.
