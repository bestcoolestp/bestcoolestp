# DevOps / SRE Portfolio

**Target role:** Associate DevOps Engineer / SRE  
**Location:** Seoul, South Korea (open to remote / relocation)

I am a **software engineer transitioning into DevOps/SRE**, with hands-on experience designing, automating, and 
operating **reliable systems** across cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes platforms.

My focus is on **infrastructure reliability, repeatable automation, and production-oriented troubleshooting**, rather than isolated, tool-only demonstrations.

- ✅ **CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator (Nov 2025)**
- Kubernetes • Docker • Jenkins • Terraform • Ansible 
- AWS • Linux • CI/CD • Observability fundamentals (metrics, logs)
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate — *in progress*
- 2+ years professional software engineering experience

Currently working as a Software Engineer at **IMGTech (South Korea)**.

## ⭐ Featured DevOps / SRE Case Studies

These case studies are ordered to reflect **how real production systems are built and operated**:
**infrastructure → delivery → platform reliability**.

---

### 1️⃣ Cloud Infrastructure Case Study — Terraform + Ansible (AWS EC2)

📂 `infra-as-code/aws-terraform-ansible-ec2`

**What this shows**
- End-to-end Infrastructure-as-Code workflow on AWS
- Clean separation of concerns:
  - Terraform → infrastructure provisioning
  - Ansible → post-provision host configuration
- Secure SSH-based automation with real-world constraints (IP restriction, key handling)
- Full lifecycle discipline (create → configure → verify → destroy)

**Key skills demonstrated**
- AWS networking fundamentals (VPC, subnet, routing, security groups)
- Terraform stateful IaC and provider management
- Ansible configuration management over SSH
- Docker-based workload deployment on cloud VMs
- Debugging across Windows, WSL, Linux, and AWS environments
- Cost-aware teardown and infrastructure hygiene

### 2️⃣ CI/CD Case Study — Jenkins → Kubernetes (kind)

📂 `ci-cd/jenkins-kind-cicd`

**What this shows**
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
- Docker image build and delivery
- Automated Kubernetes deployment
- Smoke testing with port-forward and health checks

**Key skills demonstrated**
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Jenkins in containerized environments
- Kubernetes automation
- Real-world troubleshooting (Docker CLI, kubeconfig, TLS, endpoints)

### 3️⃣ Kubernetes Reliability Case Study — Application Deployment & Scaling

📂 `k8s-projects/sample-app-deploy`

**What this shows**
- Containerized application deployment on Kubernetes
- Core Kubernetes objects: Namespace, Deployment, Service
- Horizontal scaling and self-healing behavior
- Clear, reproducible documentation (runbook-style)

**Key skills demonstrated**
- Kubernetes workload design
- Service networking
- Reliability validation (replicas, pod recreation)
- DevOps documentation discipline

## 📈 Continuous Learning & Growth

I treat DevOps/SRE as a discipline of continuous learning and system-level thinking.
I maintain public study logs to document architectural reasoning and trade-offs.

    *Focus: VPC Networking, IAM Security Policy design, and High-Availability patterns.*
