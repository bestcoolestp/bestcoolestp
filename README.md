## 🧠 DevOps / SRE Mindset

Across these projects, I focus on:

- repeatable infrastructure
- fast feedback (smoke tests)
- failure investigation and root cause analysis
- clear documentation for handoff and operation

These are not “happy-path” demos — they include real integration issues and fixes
encountered while working with Windows, Docker Desktop, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.
